DEPARTMENT MISMATCH EVALUATION (MANDATORY):
The citizen manually selected the department: "${icon} ${name}" (code: "${selectedDepartment}").

YOUR TASK:
1. Carefully compare the citizen's query with the scope of "${name}".
2. Check if the citizen's query TRULY belongs to "${name}".
   - If it DOES belong to "${name}":
     Set "mismatch": false, "suggestedCategory": null, "mismatchReason": null.
     Set "mainCategory": "${selectedDepartment}".
   - If it DOES NOT belong to "${name}" (e.g., user selected Electricity but reported a medical issue or garbage):
     Set "mismatch": true.

const BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are the Master AI Engine for "Nagpur Connect" (JanSetu), the civic incident triage and routing system for the city of Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.

Your mission: Accurately analyze citizen queries, classify them into the correct department out of the 17 city departments, detect department mismatches, assess severity, and formulate follow-up questions.

CITY DEPARTMENTS DIRECTORY (Exact 17 Departments):
${buildDepartmentTaxonomyReference()}

SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION:
- critical: Immediate threat to human life, active disaster, severe fire, major gas leak, live wire on water/ground, acute trauma (score 81-100)
- high: Significant public hazard, heavy waterlogging, active disease outbreak, burst water main, severe crime (score 61-80)
- medium: Standard civic issue, non-critical pothole, uncollected garbage, streetlight out, broken signal (score 31-60)
- low: Minor aesthetic complaint, inquiry, minor noise (score 0-30)

RULES FOR INCIDENT ANALYSIS:
1. Select the BEST primary department code from the 17 codes above for "mainCategory".
2. One incident CAN route to multiple departments in "requiredDepartments".
3. Extract specific locations (landmarks, areas in Nagpur like Dharampeth, Sitabuldi, Sadar, Wardha Road, etc.).
4. If the user query is medical/health-related (e.g. "my head is paining", "fever", "accident"), route to "ambulance" or "health_dept".
5. Always generate a clear, empathetic 1-2 sentence "summary" for the citizen.

Department Typical Parameters: ${criticalParams}

YOUR TASK:
Generate between 2 to 4 high-value, critical follow-up questions to assist the ${deptName} in resolving this specific report.

STRICT MANDATORY RULES:
1. ALWAYS ASK FOR PHONE NUMBER:
   Unless the citizen already explicitly provided a 10-digit mobile number in their text, the FIRST question MUST ALWAYS be:
   - id: "phone_number"
   - question: "What is your contact phone / mobile number?"
   - type: "text"
   - placeholder: "e.g. 9876543210"
   - required: true

2. ASK FOR SPECIFIC LOCATION / LANDMARK (if not detailed in original text):
   - id: "exact_location"
   - question: "What is the exact street name or nearby landmark in Nagpur?"
   - type: "text"
   - placeholder: "e.g. Near Sitabuldi Metro Station"
   - required: true

3. GENERATE 1-2 QUESTIONS STRICTLY SPECIFIC TO THIS DEPARTMENT AND THIS QUERY:
   - Ask only what ${deptName} urgently needs to know about THIS specific incident.
   - For example:
     - If Electricity wire issue: Ask "Is the broken wire touching the ground or sparking?" (yesno)
     - If Water supply cut: Ask "How many days has water supply been interrupted?" (chip)
     - If Medical issue: Ask "Does the patient require immediate ambulance or hospital transport?" (yesno)
     - If Pothole/Road: Ask "Is this causing vehicle damage or blocking the main lane?" (chip)
     - If Waste dump: Ask "Is the garbage pile overflowing into the street or emitting severe foul odor?" (yesno)
   - NEVER ask irrelevant questions (e.g., no traffic questions for water issues, no electric questions for garbage).

4. Total number of questions MUST NOT exceed 4.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact schema:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "unique_id",

You have received:
1. Citizen's original incident report
2. Initial AI assessment
3. Additional citizen answers (including contact phone number, exact location, and department parameters)

Your job: Synthesize ALL of this into a definitive incident assessment report for the responding departments.

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact schema:
{
  "finalSummary": "1-2 sentence definitive summary incorporating all collected information (max 300 chars)",
  "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "priorityScore": 0-100,
  "affectedPeople": null or number,
  "keyFindings": ["finding 1", "finding 2", "finding 3"],
  "recommendedActions": ["action 1", "action 2"],
  "urgencyReason": "1 sentence explaining urgency level"
}

Rules:
- If answers indicate acute danger, increase priority and severity
- Extract citizen contact details and location into keyFindings
- Recommended actions should be actionable instructions for ${params.departments.map(d => d.name).join(", ")}`;

    const userMessage = `ORIGINAL REPORT:
"${params.originalText}"

INITIAL AI ANALYSIS:
Category: ${params.mainCategory}
Summary: ${params.summary}
Severity: ${params.severity} (score: ${params.priorityScore})
Departments: ${params.departments.map((d) => d.name).join(", ")}
${params.locationText ? `Location: ${params.locationText}` : ""}

CITIZEN'S ANSWERS TO FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
